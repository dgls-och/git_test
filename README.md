# git_test

Hello Odinite  
There's much more than you can tell  
Keep going  

The test isn't over  
I'm being cursive  
Save ya head  
What if I wrote on the same line ...  
... meaning to display to another?

As tempestous as life seems,  
so time passes on life's sea.  
Yet I seek a to make a seam,  
'twill be as though I am a seal.
